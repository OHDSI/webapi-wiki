# OHDSI WebAPI Roadmap

The [Atlas & WebAPI Working Group](http://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=projects:workgroups:atlas-webapi) hold scheduled calls to review progress, technical roadblocks and timelines around new features or on-going issues. This roadmap is a reflection of the working group's commitments for this year.

## Atlas/WebAPI 2.8 - Performance Optimizations

The 2.8 release will focus on optimizing features and functions in the platform. There will also be an effort to fix any outstanding bugs from the 2.7 release.

🙌 Important note: The 2.8 release will be the final release of Atlas/WebAPI that supports the CDM v5.x specification. 

## Atlas/WebAPI 3.0 - CDM v6 Support

The 3.0 release of Atlas/WebAPI will provide support for CDM v6.x and will be a large overhaul of the code base with an eye towards maturing the platform's core components with unit/integration tests.
