# How to contribute

Contributions come in many forms: reporting issues, creating feature suggestions, asking questions via issues and of course code contributions through pull requests.

### Where to start

Before attempting to make any changes to code, please post up your question or new use cases via the [WebAPI issue tracker](https://github.com/OHDSI/WebAPI/issues). This will enable us to discuss your idea and then plan out any design and development activities.
